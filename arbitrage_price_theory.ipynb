    "# Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) is a multi-factor asset pricing model that explains the expected returns of financial assets based on their exposure to various macroeconomic risk factors. Unlike the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which uses a single factor (market risk), APT allows for multiple systematic risk factors such as interest rates, inflation, or industrial production. APT is ground in the principle of no-arbitrage, asserting that assets with identical risk exposure should have the same expecetd returns, or arbitrage oppurtunities would arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a script to estimate factor loadings for a stock using historical returns and calculate its expected return under APT. We simulate returns for simplicity, but in reality, you would use real historical data."
