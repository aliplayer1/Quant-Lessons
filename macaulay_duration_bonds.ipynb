    "# Macaulay Duration\n",
    "\n",
    "Macaulay Duration is a measure of a bond's interest rate sensitivity, defining the <u>weighted average time to receive all payments</u>. It tells you how much your bond investmnet responds to rate movements and the timing of your cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macaulay Duration was introduced by Frederick Macaulay in 1938 as a tool for quantifying interest rate risk in bonds. Over time, it became a standard in fixed income analytics for traders, asset managers, and institutions. Duration's impact grew as bond markets matured and investors needed a clear handle on risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern fixed income professionals rely on Macaulay Duration to build portfolios tailored to specific timelines and risk profiles. Portfolio managers use duration matching to immunize liabilities and avoid unexpected losses from rate hikes.\n",
